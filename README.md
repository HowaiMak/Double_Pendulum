# Chaos in the Double Pendulum
Theoretical Physics Group Project 2023-01-31
Report and presentations are also attached.

## University of Glasgow Group Project (PHYS4029P)
### Co-developed with Bartosz Sobula (2557113s), Nathan Weir (2565037w)
This report is dedicated in using mathematical models and simulations to investigate the behavior of both the simple and double pendulum under various conditions.

Our goal is to gain insights into the factors affecting pendulum motion and to demonstrate how these factors can be controlled in the case of the simple pendulum, or result in significant differences in the behavior of the double pendulum over time.

## Implementation
The simulation is run on Jupyter Notebook (ipython) and can be run easily on Windows or Mac OS using Visual Studio or from online terminals
